## Kubernetes STIG Automated Compliance Validation Profile

<b>Kubernetes 1.16</b> STIG Automated Compliance Validation Profile works with Chef InSpec to perform automated compliance checks of <b>Kubernetes</b>.

This automated Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) validator was developed to reduce the time it takes to perform a security check based upon STIG Guidance from DISA. These check results should provide information needed to receive a secure authority to operate (ATO) certification for the applicable technology.
<b>Kubernetes</b> uses [Chef InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec), which provides an open source compliance, security and policy testing framework that dynamically extracts system configuration information.

## Kubernetes STIG Overview

The <b>Kubernetes</b> STIG (https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/) by the United States Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) offers a comprehensive compliance guide for the configuration and operation of various technologies.
DISA has created and maintains a set of security guidelines for applications, computer systems or networks connected to the DoD. These guidelines are the primary security standards used by many DoD agencies. In addition to defining security guidelines, the STIG also stipulates how security training should proceed and when security checks should occur. Organizations must stay compliant with these guidelines or they risk having their access to the DoD terminated.

[STIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Technical_Implementation_Guide)s are the configuration standards for United States Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance (IA) and IA-enabled devices/systems published by the United States Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). Since 1998, DISA has played a critical role enhancing the security posture of DoD's security systems by providing the STIGs. The STIGs contain technical guidance to "lock down" information systems/software that might otherwise be vulnerable to a malicious computer attack.

The requirements associated with the <b>Kubernetes</b> STIG are derived from the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology) (NIST) [Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Revision 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53) and related documents.

While the Kubernetes STIG automation profile check was developed to provide technical guidance to validate information with security systems such as applications, the guidance applies to all organizations that need to meet internal security as well as compliance standards.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

#### Kubernetes Cluster  
- Kubernetes cluster
- Access to the Kubernetes cluster master node
- Account providing appropriate permissions to perform audit scan


#### Required software on Kubernetes Cluster Master Node 
- git
- [InSpec](https://www.chef.io/products/chef-inspec/)

### Setup Environment on Kubernetes Cluster Master Node 
#### Install InSpec
Goto https://www.inspec.io/downloads/ and consult the documentation for you Operating System to download and install InSpec.

#### Ensure your InSpec version is at least 4.23.10 
```sh
inspec --version
```

### How to execute this instance  
(See: https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/)

#### Execute a single Control in the Profile 
**Note**: Replace the profile's directory name - e.g. - `<Profile>` with `.` if you are in the profile's root directory.
```sh
inspec exec <Profile>/controls/V-00028.rb --show-progress
```
or use the --controls flag to execute checking with a subset of controls
```sh
inspec exec <Profile> --controls=V-00028 V-00029 --show-progress
```

#### Execute a Single Control and save results as JSON 
```sh
inspec exec <Profile> --controls=V-00028 --show-progress --reporter json:results.json
```

#### Execute All Controls in the Profile 
```sh
inspec exec <Profile> --show-progress
```

#### Execute all the Controls in the Profile and save results as JSON 
```sh
inspec exec <Profile> --show-progress  --reporter json:results.json
```
